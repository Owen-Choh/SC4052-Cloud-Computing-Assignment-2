OK. I will create a README.md file for the repository SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2. Here's the content I'll use, designed to be beginner-friendly:

# SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2

## Description

This repository contains the code and related resources for the Cloud Computing Assignment 2. The assignment focuses on [ Briefly describe the assignment topic, e.g., deploying a web application on a cloud platform, building a serverless function, etc.].

## Overview

The repository is structured as follows:

*   `[Directory/File 1]`: [Brief description of the directory/file and its purpose. E.g., `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.]
*   `[Directory/File 2]`: [Brief description. E.g., `terraform/`: Contains Terraform configuration files for infrastructure deployment.]
*   `[Directory/File 3]`: [Brief description. E.g., `scripts/`: Contains scripts for setup, deployment, or other utility functions.]
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Architecture (If Applicable)

[If your assignment involves a specific architecture, provide a brief overview here.  For example:]

The application follows a microservices architecture, with the following key components:

*   **Web Frontend:**  A user interface built with [framework/language] for interacting with the application.
*   **API Gateway:**  A central point of entry for all requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services.
*   **Backend Services:**  Individual services responsible for specific functionalities, such as user authentication, data storage, etc.

[You can include a simple diagram here if it helps to visualize the architecture.]

## Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   [List any software or tools that need to be installed. E.g.,  Python 3.8+, Terraform, AWS CLI, etc.]
    *   [Specify any required cloud provider accounts and configurations. E.g., An AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions.]

2.  **Installation:**
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
    *   [Provide instructions for installing dependencies. E.g.,  Navigate to the `src/` directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.]

3.  **Configuration:**
    *   [Explain how to configure the application. E.g., Create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables (API keys, database credentials, etc.).  See `.env.example` for a template.]
    *   [If using Terraform, explain how to configure the provider. E.g., Configure the AWS provider with your credentials.]

4.  **Deployment:**
    *   [Provide instructions for deploying the application. E.g.,  Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure.]
    *   [Explain how to start the application. E.g., Run `python app.py` in the `src/` directory.]

5.  **Usage:**
    *   [Explain how to use the application. E.g., Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.]
    *   [Provide examples of how to interact with the application's API.]

## Important Notes

*   **Do not commit your `.env` file** containing sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) to the repository.  Add it to your `.gitignore` file.
*   [Add any other important notes or caveats here. E.g.,  The application is designed for development purposes only and may not be suitable for production use.]
*   [Note any known issues or limitations.]

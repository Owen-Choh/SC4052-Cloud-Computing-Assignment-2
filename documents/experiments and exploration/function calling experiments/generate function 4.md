## Description

This repository contains the code and related resources for the SC4052 Cloud Computing Assignment 2.  It likely includes code for deploying and managing applications on a cloud platform, along with any necessary configuration files, scripts, and documentation. The specific functionality will depend on the assignment requirements.

## Overview of the Code

The repository structure and code components will vary depending on the specifics of the assignment. However, it might contain:

*   **Application Code:** Source code for the application being deployed (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js).
*   **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) files:** Files that define the cloud infrastructure (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM templates).
*   **Configuration Files:** Configuration files for the application and cloud services (e.g., YAML, JSON).
*   **Scripts:** Scripts for deployment, automation, and other tasks (e.g., Bash, Python).
*   **Documentation:** README files, design documents, or other documentation explaining the project.

## Architecture

[This section should be updated based on the actual architecture of the deployed application.]

If applicable, include a diagram or description of the application's architecture. This might include:

*   The cloud services used (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine).
*   The application components and their interactions.
*   The data flow through the system.
*   Any load balancers, databases, or other infrastructure components.

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    *   A cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
    *   The necessary command-line tools (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI, gcloud CLI).
    *   Terraform or other IaC tools, if used.
    *   Python, Node.js, or other runtime environments, if required.

2.  **Configuration:**

    *   Configure your cloud provider credentials.
    *   Set any necessary environment variables.
    *   Install any required dependencies.

3.  **Deployment:**

    *   Use the provided scripts or IaC files to deploy the application to your cloud environment.
    *   Follow the instructions in the assignment documentation.

4.  **Usage:**

    *   Access the deployed application through the appropriate URL or endpoint.
    *   Test the application's functionality.

## Important Notes

*   **Do not commit your `.env` file or any other files containing sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) to the repository.** Use environment variables or a secrets management service instead.
*   Ensure that your cloud resources are properly secured.
*   Follow the principles of least privilege when granting permissions to cloud resources.
*   Clean up your cloud resources after you are finished to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
*   Refer to the assignment documentation for specific instructions and requirements.

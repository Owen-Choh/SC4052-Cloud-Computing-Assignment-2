# SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2

This repository contains the code for a GitHub Search SaaS application, built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to search for code snippets within GitHub repositories, generate documentation, and create README files using AI.

## Overview

The application provides a user interface with three main tabs:

-   **General Info:** Allows users to input their GitHub token, username, and select a repository.
-   **Code Search:** Enables users to search for specific code snippets within the selected repository or across GitHub.
-   **Code Edit:** Provides functionality to generate documentation or a README file for the selected repository, using the search results and AI.

## Code Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture, with the main components located in the `github-search-saas/src/components` directory:

-   `App.tsx`: The main application component that manages the overall layout and tab switching.
-   `GeneralInfo.tsx`: Component for handling GitHub token, username, and repository selection.
-   `CodeSearch.tsx`: Component for searching code snippets within GitHub.
-   `CodeEdit.tsx`: Component for generating documentation and README files using AI.

The application uses the following libraries:

-   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
-   **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
-   **Octokit:** A GitHub API client for interacting with the GitHub API.
-   **Google Gemini API:** Used for AI-powered documentation and README generation.

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `github-search-saas` directory and add your GitHub token and Gemini API key:

    ```
    VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
    ```

    **Important:** Do not commit your `.env` file to the repository. Add it to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the application in your browser.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please submit a pull request with your changes.

## Important Notes

-   **GitHub Token:** Ensure your GitHub token has the necessary permissions to search code and create pull requests.
-   **API Keys:** Keep your API keys secure and do not commit them to the repository. Use environment variables to store your API keys.
-   **Cache:** The application uses a cache to store repository file contents and AI-generated output. Clear the cache if you encounter issues or want to regenerate content.

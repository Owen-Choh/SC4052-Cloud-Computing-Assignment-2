It provides a user interface for searching and editing code from GitHub repositories using the GitHub API and the Gemini AI model.\n\n## Description\n\nThis project provides a simple Software as a Service (SaaS) interface for GitHub code search and editing, enhanced by the power of AI. It allows users to search for code snippets within specified repositories, view code content, and generate documentation or README files using the Gemini AI model. The application is structured into three main tabs: General Information, Code Search, and Code Edit.\n\n## Overview\n\n*   **General Information:** Allows users to input their GitHub token, username, and repository name.
*   **Code Search:** Enables users to search for code snippets within the specified repository and file types.
*   **Code Edit:** Provides functionalities to generate documentation or README files for the selected repository using the Gemini AI model.\n\n### Key Components\n\n*   `github-search-saas/src/App.tsx`: Main application component that manages the overall layout and tab navigation.
*   `github-search-saas/src/components/GeneralInfo.tsx`: Component for handling GitHub token, username, and repository input.
*   `github-search-saas/src/components/CodeSearch.tsx`: Component for searching code snippets within the specified repository and file types.
*   `github-search-saas/src/components/CodeEdit.tsx`: Component for generating documentation or README files using the Gemini AI model.
*   `github-search-saas/src/context/useGithubContext.tsx`: Provides context for managing and sharing state across different components.
*   `github-search-saas/src/api/apiconfigs.tsx`: Contains API configurations and setup for interacting with the GitHub API and Gemini AI model.
*   `github-search-saas/src/geminiAPI/geminiAPI.tsx`: Includes functions for interacting with the Gemini AI model to generate content and documentation.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe application follows a component-based architecture with React, utilizing context to manage the global state. It interacts with the GitHub API to search for code and retrieve file contents, and it uses the Gemini AI model to generate documentation or README files. The API keys are stored in the env file and accessed through environment variables, the app then calls the submitPullRequest function to submit the updated README file to the repository.\n\n## Setup and Usage\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   Node.js and npm installed on your machine.\n*   A GitHub account with a personal access token (PAT) that has the `repo` scope.
*   A Google Cloud project with the Gemini API enabled and an API key.\n\n### Installation\n\n1.  Clone the repository:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2.git\n    cd SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2\n    ```\n\n2.  Install the dependencies:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n### Configuration\n\n1.  Create a `.env` file in the `github-search-saas/` directory.\n\n2.  Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:\n\n    ```\n    VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\nVITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY\n    ```\n\n    **Important:** Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual tokens.\n\n    **Note:** NEVER commit your `.env` file to the repository to avoid exposing your API keys.\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1.  Start the development server:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.\n\n### Using the Application\n\n1.  **General Information Tab:**\n\n    *   Enter your GitHub token in the "GitHub Token" field.
*   Enter your GitHub username in the "GitHub Username" field.
*   Select the repository name from the dropdown list after pressing "Get Repos" (make sure the username is populated first).\n\n2.  **Code Search Tab:**\n\n    *   Enter your search query in the "Enter code snippet..." field.
*   Optionally, filter by file types using comma-separated values in the "Filter by comma seperated file types..." field.
*   Click the "Search" button to display the search results.
*   Click the "Describe" button next to each result to generate a description of the code using the Gemini AI model.\n\n3.  **Code Edit Tab:**\n\n    *   Select items from the search results in the "Code Search" tab.
*   Click either the "Generate Documentation" or "Generate README" button to generate the corresponding content using the Gemini AI model.
*   View the generated content in the "Output" text area.
*   Click the "Download" button to download the generated content as a markdown file.
*   Click the "Submit Pull Request" button to submit a pull request with the generated content to the repository.\n\n## Notes\n\n*   Make sure to set the `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variables in the `.env` file.\n*   Do not commit the `.env` file to the repository to avoid exposing your API keys.\n*   The application uses a cache to store the generated content and repository file contents, making the buttons faster.\n*   The application will automatically submit a pull request if the "Auto Submit Pull Request?" checkbox is checked.\n'

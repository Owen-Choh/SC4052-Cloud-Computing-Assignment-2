## Description

This repository contains the code and related resources for the SC4052 Cloud Computing Assignment 2. The assignment likely involves deploying and managing applications on a cloud platform, utilizing various cloud services, and implementing cloud computing concepts.

## Overview

The repository structure and code components will vary depending on the specific requirements of the assignment. However, it generally includes:

*   **Codebase:** Source code for the application(s) deployed on the cloud.
*   **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):** Configuration files (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
*   **Deployment Scripts:** Scripts for automating the deployment process.
*   **Documentation:** Any supporting documentation, such as architecture diagrams or setup instructions.

## Architecture (If Applicable)

[A brief description of the system architecture, if applicable. Include a diagram if possible. For example:]

The application follows a microservices architecture, with each service deployed as a separate container on Kubernetes. API Gateway handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate service. A message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) is used for asynchronous communication between services.

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   A cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
    *   Appropriate CLI tools installed and configured (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI, gcloud CLI).
    *   Terraform or other IaC tools (if used).
    *   Python 3.x
    *   Docker (if containerized)

2.  **Installation:**
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable)

3.  **Configuration:**
    *   Configure your cloud provider credentials.
    *   Set environment variables as needed (refer to the application documentation).
    *   **Important:** Do not commit your `.env` file or any files containing sensitive information to the repository. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system instead.

4.  **Deployment:**
    *   Run the deployment scripts or use the IaC configuration to provision cloud resources.
    *   Deploy the application code to the provisioned resources.

5.  **Usage:**
    *   Access the application through the appropriate endpoint (e.g., URL, IP address).
    *   Refer to the application documentation for usage instructions.

## Important Notes

*   **Security:** Never commit sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) directly to the repository. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
*   **Cost Management:** Be mindful of the cost implications of deploying and running resources on the cloud. Monitor your cloud provider account for unexpected charges.
*   **Clean Up:** Remember to deprovision any resources that are no longer needed to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
*   **Environment Variables:** Ensure you do not commit your `.env` file to the repository as this can expose sensitive information.

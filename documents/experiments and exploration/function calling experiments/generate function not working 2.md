It provides a simple interface for searching code on GitHub and generating documentation using the Gemini API.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe application is structured into three main tabs:\n\n-   **General Info:** Allows you to set your GitHub token, username, and repository.\n-   **CodeSearch:** Enables you to search for code snippets within a specified repository or across all of GitHub.\n-   **CodeEdit:** Provides functionality to generate documentation and README files for your projects using the Gemini API.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe application follows a component-based architecture, with the main components located in the `src/components` directory:\n\n-   `App.tsx`: The main application component that manages the tab structure and provides the overall layout.\n-   `GeneralInfo.tsx`: Component for setting GitHub credentials and repository information.\n-   `CodeSearch.tsx`: Component for searching code on GitHub.\n-   `CodeEdit.tsx`: Component for generating documentation and README files.\n\nThe application uses the following libraries:\n\n-   React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\n-   TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.\n-   Vite: A build tool that provides fast development and optimized builds.\n-   Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework.\n-   Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.\n-   Octokit: A TypeScript library for accessing the GitHub API.\n-   @google/generative-ai: A library for accessing the Gemini API.\n-   react-markdown: A library for rendering Markdown.\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  Clone the repository:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    cd SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2/github-search-saas\n    ```\n\n2.  Install the dependencies:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n3.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your GitHub token and Gemini API key:\n\n    ```\n    VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>\nVITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>\n    ```\n\n4.  Start the development server:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n\n1.  Navigate to the **General Info** tab and enter your GitHub token and username. Select the repository you want to work with.\n2.  Go to the **CodeSearch** tab and enter your search query. You can also filter by file types.\n3.  In the **CodeEdit** tab, you can generate documentation or a README file based on the code you searched for. You can also adjust the model temperature to control the variation in the output.\n4.  Click the **Generate Documentation** or **Generate README** button to generate the content. The generated content will appear in the output textarea.\n5.  You can download the generated content as a Markdown file or submit a pull request to your repository.\n\n## Notes\n\n-   **Do not commit your `.env` file** to the repository, as it contains sensitive information.\n-   The Gemini API has usage limits. Be mindful of your usage to avoid exceeding the limits.\n-   The quality of the generated documentation depends on the quality of the code and the clarity of the search query.\n', pullRequestTitle='Suggested README file', pullRequestBody='This pull request adds a suggested README file for the repository.', filePath='README.md'))

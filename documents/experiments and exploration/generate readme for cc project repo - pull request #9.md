The application consists of a React frontend, a Go backend, and a Caddy reverse proxy, all designed to be containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose. The backend leverages the Gemini API for conversational AI capabilities.\n\n## Codebase Structure\n\nThe repository is structured as follows:\n\n- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.\n- `Caddyfile`: Configuration file for the Caddy reverse proxy.\n- `chatbot-app/`: Contains the React frontend application.\n    - `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the React frontend.\n    - `nginx/`: Contains the Nginx configuration.\n        - `default.conf`: Nginx configuration file.\n    - `src/`: Contains the React source code.\n        - `App.tsx`: Main application component.\n        - `api/`: API client for interacting with the backend.\n        - `auth/`: Authentication-related components.\n        - `components/`: Reusable React components.\n        - `pages/`: React pages for different routes.\n        - `context/`: React context providers.\n    - `frontend-env-example.txt`: Example environment variables for the frontend.\n    - `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration file.\n    - `eslint.config.js`: ESLint configuration file.\n- `chatbot-backend/`: Contains the Go backend application.\n    - `main.go`: Main application file.\n    - `Makefile`: Makefile for building and testing the Go backend.\n    - `chatbot/`:\n        - `auth/`: Authentication logic.\n        - `config/`: Configuration management.\n        - `db/`: Database initialization and connection.\n        - `service/`:\n            - `chatbotservice/`: Chatbot management service.\n            - `conversation/`: Conversation management service.\n            - `user/`: User management service.\n        - `types/`: Data structures and interfaces.\n    - `utils/`:\n        - `middleware/`: HTTP middleware.\n        - `validate/`: Validation utilities.\n    - `backend-env-example.txt`: Example environment variables for the backend.\n- `docker-compose.yaml`: Docker Compose file for orchestrating the application.\n- `.dockerignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Docker should ignore.\n- `secrets/`: Directory to store secrets, such as API keys (not included in the repository, create your own).\n    - `gemini_api_key.txt`\n    - `jwt_secret.txt`\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe application follows a microservices architecture, with the frontend and backend running as separate containers. Caddy acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests to the appropriate service. The backend interacts with a SQLite database to store user, chatbot, and conversation data. The Gemini API is used to generate chatbot responses.\n\n```\n[Client] --> [Caddy Reverse Proxy] --> [React Frontend] \n                                    --> [Go Backend + Gemini API + SQLite]\n```\n\n## Setup and Usage\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and running.\n- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.\n- A Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).\n\n### Installation\n\n1.  Clone the repository:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository_url>\n    cd SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Project\n    ```\n\n2.  Create a `.env` file in both the `chatbot-app/` and `chatbot-backend/` directories, using the `frontend-env-example.txt` and `backend-env-example.txt` files as templates.  Fill in the required environment variables, including your Gemini API key.\n\n3.  Create a `secrets` directory at the root of the project.\n\n4.  Create two files inside the `secrets` directory:\n    - `gemini_api_key.txt`:  Paste your Gemini API key into this file.\n    - `jwt_secret.txt`: Generate a strong, random secret key and paste it into this file.\n\n5.  Run docker compose:\n\n    ```bash\n    docker-compose up --build\n    ```\n\n    This command builds the Docker images and starts the application.\n\n### Usage\n\nOnce the application is running, you can access the frontend in your web browser at `http://localhost` or the configured domain in the Caddyfile.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Do not commit your `.env` files or the `secrets` directory to the repository.** These files contain sensitive information, such as API keys and secrets, which should be kept confidential.\n- Ensure that Docker is properly installed and running before attempting to build and run the application.\n- The application uses a SQLite database, which is stored in the `database_files/` directory. This directory is persisted as a Docker volume.\n- The Caddyfile is configured to use a self-signed certificate for HTTPS. You may need to configure your browser to trust this certificate.\n- The frontend communicates with the backend via API calls. The base URL for these API calls is configured in the `.env` file.\n- The backend uses the Gemini API to generate chatbot responses. Ensure that you have a valid API key and that it is properly configured in the `.env` file.\n",

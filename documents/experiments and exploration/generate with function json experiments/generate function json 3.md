    "fileContent": "# SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2\n\nThis repository contains a React-based Single Page Application (SPA) built with TypeScript and Vite. It provides a user interface for interacting with the GitHub API and Gemini AI to search and edit code, generate documentation, and manage pull requests.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe application is structured into three main tabs:\n\n*   **General Info:** Allows users to input their GitHub token, username, and select a repository.\n*   **Code Search:** Enables users to search for code snippets within the selected repository using a query and file type filters. It leverages the GitHub Code Search API and Gemini AI to describe the code.\n*   **Code Edit:** Provides functionality to generate documentation or a README file for the repository using Gemini AI. It also supports submitting a pull request with the generated content.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe application follows a component-based architecture, with the main components being:\n\n*   `App.tsx`: The main application component that manages the tab navigation.\n*   `GeneralInfo.tsx`: Component for inputting GitHub credentials and selecting a repository.\n*   `CodeSearch.tsx`: Component for searching code and displaying results.\n*   `CodeEdit.tsx`: Component for generating documentation and submitting pull requests.\n*   `GithubContext.tsx`: Provides a context for managing the application state, such as the GitHub token, username, repository, and search results.\n\n## Setup and Usage\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    cd SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2/github-search-saas\n    ```\n2.  **Install dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the `github-search-saas` folder and add your GitHub token and Gemini API key:\n    ```\n    VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>\nVITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>\n    ```\n4.  **Start the development server:**\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n5.  **Open the application in your browser** at the address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).\n6.  **Enter your GitHub token, username, and repository** in the \"General Info\" tab.\n7.  **Search for code** in the \"Code Search\" tab.\n8.  **Generate documentation or a README** in the \"Code Edit\" tab and submit a pull request.\n\n## Notes\n\n*   **Do not commit your `.env` file** to the repository, as it contains sensitive information.\n*   The application uses the GitHub API, so you may be subject to rate limits. Consider using a personal access token with the appropriate scopes to avoid rate limiting.\n*   The Gemini AI integration requires a valid API key and may incur costs depending on your usage.\n*   The auto pull request feature is experimental and may not always work as expected. Review the generated content before submitting a pull request.\n",

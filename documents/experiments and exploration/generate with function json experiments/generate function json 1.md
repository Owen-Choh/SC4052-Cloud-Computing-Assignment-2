It fetches and displays available repositories for the given username.\n-   **CodeSearch:** Enables searching for code snippets within the selected GitHub repository, also supports filtering by file types.\n-   **CodeEdit:** Provides functionality to generate documentation or a README file for the repository using a language model.\n\n## Code Architecture\n\nThe application follows a component-based architecture:\n\n-   `App.tsx`: Main component that renders the sidebar and main content area. It manages tab switching.\n-   `GeneralInfo.tsx`: Component for displaying and handling general information inputs.\n-   `CodeSearch.tsx`: Component for code search functionality.\n-   `CodeEdit.tsx`: Component for code editing and documentation generation.\n-   `GithubContext`: Provides a context for sharing state across components, such as username, repository, and token.\n\n## Setup and Usage\n\n1.  Clone the repository.\n2.  Install dependencies:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n3.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your GitHub token and Gemini API key:\n\n    ```\n    VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN\nVITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY\n    ```\n\n    **Important:** Do not commit the `.env` file to the repository.\n4.  Start the development server:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.\n6.  Enter your GitHub token and username in the \"General Information\" tab.\n7.  Select a repository from the dropdown menu.\n8.  In the \"CodeSearch\" tab, enter a code snippet to search for and filter by file types.\n9.  In the \"CodeEdit\" tab, generate documentation or a README file for your repository.\n\n## Notes\n\n-   Ensure that you have set the `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with a valid GitHub token.\n-   Be cautious not to commit your `.env` file, which contains sensitive information.\n-   Consider using the \"Clear Cache\" buttons to ensure updated responses from the language model.\n",

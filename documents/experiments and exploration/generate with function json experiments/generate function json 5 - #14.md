It allows users to:\n\n*   Search for code snippets within public GitHub repositories.\n*   View general information about a repository.\n*   Generate documentation for a selected repository using the Gemini AI model.\n*   Edit code and submit pull requests directly from the web interface.\n\n## Overview of the Code\n\nThe application is structured as follows:\n\n*   `github-search-saas/src/App.tsx`: This is the main application component that sets up the layout and routing between different tabs (GeneralInfo, CodeSearch, CodeEdit).\n*   `github-search-saas/src/components`: This directory contains React components for each tab:\n    *   `CodeSearch.tsx`: Implements the code search functionality, allowing users to query GitHub repositories for specific code snippets.\n    *   `GeneralInfo.tsx`: Provides an interface for users to input their GitHub username and select a repository.\n    *   `CodeEdit.tsx`: Enables users to generate documentation and README files using AI, and submit pull requests.\n*   `github-search-saas/src/context/useGithubContext.tsx`: Defines a React context to manage and share state across different components, such as the GitHub username, repository name, and search query.\n*   `github-search-saas/src/api/apiconfigs.tsx`: Configures the API clients for interacting with the GitHub API, including setting the base URLs and authentication headers.\n*   `github-search-saas/src/geminiAPI/geminiAPI.tsx`: Implements the integration with the Gemini AI model for generating documentation and README files.\n*   `github-search-saas/vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for Vite, the build tool used in this project.\n*   `github-search-saas/eslint.config.js`: Configuration file for ESLint, the linting tool used in this project.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe application follows a component-based architecture using React. It utilizes a context provider to manage global state and Axios to make API requests to GitHub. The Gemini AI integration is encapsulated in a separate module to handle documentation generation.\n\n## Setup and Usage\n\nFollow these steps to set up and run the application:\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    cd SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2/github-search-saas\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install dependencies:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n3.  **Configure environment variables:**\n\n    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:\n\n    ```\n    VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>\nVITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>\n    ```\n\n    Replace `<your_github_token>` with your personal GitHub access token and `<your_gemini_api_key>` with your Gemini API key.  You can generate a GitHub token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You can obtain a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).\n\n4.  **Run the application:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n    This will start the development server. Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).\n\n5.  **Using the application:**\n\n    *   Enter your GitHub username and select a repository in the \"General Information\" tab.\n    *   Search for code snippets in the \"Code Search\" tab.\n    *   Generate documentation or a README file for the selected repository in the \"Code Edit\" tab.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n*   **Do not commit your `.env` file** to the repository, as it contains sensitive information such as your GitHub token and Gemini API key. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.\n*   The application uses the GitHub API, so be mindful of the [API rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting).",

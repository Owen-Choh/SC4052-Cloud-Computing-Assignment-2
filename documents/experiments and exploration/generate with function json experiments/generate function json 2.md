    "fileContent": "# SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2\n\nThis repository contains a React-based SaaS application for searching and editing code on GitHub, enhanced with Gemini AI integration for documentation and README generation.\n\n## Description\n\nThis project implements a cloud computing solution that allows users to search for code snippets within GitHub repositories, view general repository information, and edit code directly through the application. It leverages React for the frontend, TypeScript for type safety, and Vite for a fast development experience. The application also integrates with the Gemini AI API to provide automated documentation and README generation based on the repository's code.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe application is structured into several main components:\n\n-   **GeneralInfo:** Allows users to input a GitHub username and select a repository to view general information.\n-   **CodeSearch:** Enables users to search for specific code snippets within the selected repository, filtering by file types.\n-   **CodeEdit:** Provides functionality to generate documentation or a README file for the repository using Gemini AI, and submit a pull request with the generated content.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe application follows a component-based architecture, with React components handling the UI and state management. It uses the Github Context to manage the state of the application. The application interacts with the GitHub API for code search and retrieval, and the Gemini AI API for content generation.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo run this project locally, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Clone the repository:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    cd SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2/github-search-saas\n    ```\n\n2.  Install the dependencies:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n3.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the `github-search-saas` folder and add your GitHub token and Gemini API key:\n\n    ```\n    VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>\nVITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>\n    ```\n\n4.  Start the development server:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.\n\n## Usage\n\n1.  Enter your GitHub username and token in the General Information tab.\n2.  Select a repository from the dropdown menu.\n3.  In the Code Search tab, enter a code snippet to search for and filter by file types if desired.\n4.  In the Code Edit tab, select the files you want to generate documentation or a README for, and click the corresponding button.\n5.  If you want to submit a pull request with the generated content, click the \"Submit Pull Request\" button.\n\n## Notes\n\n-   **Do not commit your `.env` file** to the repository, as it contains sensitive information.\n-   Ensure that your GitHub token has the necessary permissions to search and create pull requests in the selected repository.\n-   The Gemini AI API has usage limits, so be mindful of the number of requests you make.\n",

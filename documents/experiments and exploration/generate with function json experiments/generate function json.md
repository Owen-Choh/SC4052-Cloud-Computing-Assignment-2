It provides a user interface for searching and editing code within GitHub repositories, leveraging the GitHub API and Google's Gemini API for code understanding and documentation.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe application is structured into three main sections, accessible through a sidebar:\n\n-   **General Info:** Allows users to input their GitHub token, username, and select a repository.\n-   **Code Search:** Enables users to search for code snippets within the selected repository, filtering by file types.\n-   **Code Edit:** Provides functionality to generate documentation or a README file for the repository, with options to automatically submit a pull request.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe application follows a component-based architecture, with the main components being:\n\n-   `App`: The main application component that manages the overall layout and tab navigation.\n-   `GeneralInfo`: Component for inputting GitHub credentials and selecting a repository.\n-   `CodeSearch`: Component for searching code within a repository.\n-   `CodeEdit`: Component for generating documentation and README files.\n-   `GithubProvider`: Context provider for managing and sharing GitHub-related state across the application.\n\nThe application uses the following libraries:\n\n-   React: For building the user interface.\n-   TypeScript: For type-safe JavaScript development.\n-   Vite: For fast development build tool.\n-   Tailwind CSS: For styling the application.\n-   Octokit: For interacting with the GitHub API.\n-   Google GenAI: For generating code descriptions and documentation.\n\n## Setup and Usage\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    cd SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2/github-search-saas\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install dependencies:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n3.  **Set up environment variables:**\n\n    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the `github-search-saas` folder and add your GitHub token and Gemini API key:\n\n    ```\n    VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>\nVITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>\n    ```\n\n4.  **Run the application:**\n\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.\n\n5.  **Use the application:**\n\n    -   Enter your GitHub token and username in the \"General Info\" tab.\n    -   Select a repository from the dropdown menu.\n    -   In the \"Code Search\" tab, enter a search query and file types to find code snippets.\n    -   In the \"Code Edit\" tab, generate documentation or a README file for the repository.\n    -   Optionally, enable the \"Auto Submit Pull Request\" option to automatically submit a pull request with the generated content.\n\n## Notes\n\n-   **Do not commit your `.env` file** to the repository, as it contains sensitive information.\n-   The application uses caching to improve performance. You can clear the cache in the \"Code Edit\" tab.\n-   The \"Auto Submit Pull Request\" feature will automatically submit a pull request to the repository with the generated content. Use this feature with caution.\n",

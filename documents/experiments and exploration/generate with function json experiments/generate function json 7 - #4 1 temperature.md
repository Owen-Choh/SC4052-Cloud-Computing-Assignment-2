The chatbot consists of a React frontend, a Go backend, and a Caddy server for routing and security. This README provides a comprehensive guide for setting up and using the application.\n\n## Repository Contents\n\n- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and setup instructions.\n- `Caddyfile`: Configuration file for the Caddy web server.\n- `chatbot-app/`: Contains the React frontend code.\n  - `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the React frontend.\n  - `nginx/`: Contains Nginx configuration.\n  - `src/`: React source code.\n  - `frontend-env-example.txt`: Example environment variables for the frontend.\n- `chatbot-backend/`: Contains the Go backend code.\n  - `main.go`: Main application file for the Go backend.\n  - `Makefile`: Makefile for building the Go backend.\n  - `backend-env-example.txt`: Example environment variables for the backend.\n- `docker-compose.yaml`: Docker Compose file for orchestrating the services.\n- `.dockerignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Docker should ignore.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe application follows a microservices architecture, comprising of the following components:\n\n1.  **React Frontend**: Handles the user interface and interacts with the backend API.\n2.  **Go Backend**: Processes user requests, interacts with the Gemini API, and manages the database.\n3.  **Caddy Server**: Serves the React frontend and reverse proxies API requests to the Go backend. It also handles TLS encryption.\n4.  **Database**: SQLite database to store users, chatbots and conversation data. \n\n## Code Overview\n\n### Frontend (`chatbot-app/`)\n\nThe frontend is built using React and Vite. Key components include:\n\n- `src/App.tsx`: Main application component, handles routing and authentication.\n- `src/pages/`: Contains various pages like login, dashboard and conversation page.\n- `src/auth/`: Authentication related components and functions.\n- `src/api/`: API configuration and functions to interact with the backend.\n- `src/components/`: Reusable React components.\n\n### Backend (`chatbot-backend/`)\n\nThe backend is built using Go and uses SQLite for the database. Key components include:\n\n- `main.go`: Sets up the HTTP server, registers routes, and initializes the database.\n- `chatbot/`: Contains chatbot related functionalities.\n- `utils/`: Contains utility functions such as middleware and validation.\n- `chatbot/service/`: Implements business logic for user, chatbot, and conversation management.\n- `chatbot/db/`: Database initialization and connection logic.\n\n### Caddy\n\n- `Caddyfile`: Configures Caddy to serve static files and proxy requests.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n\nFollow these steps to set up and run the application:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.\n- An account in Docker Hub. \n\n### Configuration\n\n1.  **Environment Variables**: \n\n    - Create `.env` files in both `chatbot-app/` and `chatbot-backend/` directories.\n    - Copy the contents from `frontend-env-example.txt` and `backend-env-example.txt` respectively.\n    - Fill in the required values, such as API keys and database paths.\n    - For backend, you can set `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET` directly in `.env` file or refer them to a secret file. \n\n    **Important:** Do not commit your `.env` files to the repository to avoid exposing sensitive information.\n\n2.  **Caddy Configuration**: \n\n    - Ensure that the `Caddyfile` is correctly configured to point to your backend and frontend services. Modify domain name as required.\n\n### Building and Running the Application\n\n1.  **Build the application**: \n\n    ```bash\n    docker-compose build\n    ```\n\n2.  **Run the application**: \n\n    ```bash\n    docker-compose up -d\n    ```\n\n    This command builds the Docker images and starts the services in detached mode.\n\n3.  **Access the application**: \n\n    - Open your web browser and navigate to the specified domain in `Caddyfile` (e.g., `http://localhost` if running locally).\n\n## Usage\n\n1.  **Register or Login**: \n\n    - New users can register via the login page, while existing users can log in with their credentials.\n\n2.  **Create Chatbot**: \n\n    - After logging in, users can create a new chatbot via the dashboard. They can customise the chatbot by providing behaviour instructions, a user context and uploading knowledge files.\n\n3.  **Chat with Chatbot**: \n\n    - Once created, users can start chatting with their chatbots and view the generated response.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Security**: Ensure that your API keys and other sensitive information are stored securely and not committed to the repository.\n- **Environment Variables**: Always use environment variables for configuration to avoid hardcoding values in the code.\n- **File Uploads**: Limit the size and type of uploaded files to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure optimal performance.\n- **Database**: The application uses SQLite for simplicity. For production environments, consider using a more robust database system.\n- **API Keys**: Ensure that the Gemini API key is correctly set in the backend environment variables. Without it, the chatbot will not be able to generate responses.",

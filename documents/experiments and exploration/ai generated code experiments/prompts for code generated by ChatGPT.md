# Prompt used to generate the loginpage:
```
Help me write a complete login page in react for my app named "SimpleChat".
this login page must serve two functions, to allow users to login and register.
a user needs both a username and a password to login.
to register for an account, a user needs to provide a username and password. UI should allow password to be input twice for it to be confirmed as users may type wrongly into the password field.
it needs to interact with the backend endpoints ${baseURL}/user/register to register for an account and ${baseURL}/user/login to login.
validate the username to be alphanumeric and at least 3 characters.
validate the password to be at least 8 characters.
display any error message that may happen on the UI.
have a simple welcome message above the login and register form to welcome users. include a "Click here to understand how to use our app" in the welcome message, the "here" should be linked to "https://localhost/chat/SimpleChat/FAQ"
after login, the frontend needs to navigate to the /dashboard page
```

Here's a complete login/registration page in React for your "SimpleChat" app. It includes:
A toggle between login and registration.
Client-side validation for username and password.
API requests to ${baseURL}/user/login and ${baseURL}/user/register.
Error handling and UI feedback.
Navigation to /dashboard on successful login.
A welcome message with a link to your FAQ.
Let me know if you want to add styling improvements, animations, or handle session storage/token management!

# Prompt used to generate the userservice:
```
help write the userservice.go for the golang backend 
it needs to contain a Handler struct that contains a "store" attribute of type types.UserStoreInterface that implements functions to interact with the database.
it needs to contain a NewHandler function that creates a handler with the "store" added.
the userservice uses cookies to handle authentication, cookies must be HttpOnly=true, Secure=true, and SameSite=http.SameSiteStrictMode

the userservice should contain routes below
1. at / to return "Hello from user" for debugging
2. at /login to handle logins
3. at /register to handle registration
4. at /logout to return an empty cookie to remove the cookie set on users browsers
5. at /auth/check to check if the cookie is valid. it should use the middleware auth.WithJWTAuth(h.YOUR_HANDLER, h.store) to help validate the cookie and return the userid and username set in the request context by the middleware.

use the function from the utils package func WriteJSON(w http.ResponseWriter, statusCode int, payload any) error to send responses to the user
use the function from the utils package func WriteError(w http.ResponseWriter, statusCode int, err error) to send error responses to the user
```

## Response from ChatGPT 16 April:

```
Your `userservice.go` is now set up with:

- A `Handler` struct holding a `UserStoreInterface`.
- Routes for login, registration, logout, root (debug), and auth check.
- JWT-based authentication with cookies using secure settings.
- Utility functions for writing JSON and error responses.
- Middleware integration for protected routes.

Let me know if you want to implement the middleware, JWT utility, or mock the store for testing!

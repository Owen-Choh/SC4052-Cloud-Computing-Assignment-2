# SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2\n\nThis repository contains a React application built with TypeScript and Vite. It provides a simple interface for searching GitHub code and generating documentation or README files using the Gemini API.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe application is structured into three main tabs:\n\n-   **General Info:** Allows you to set your GitHub token, username, and repository.\n-   **Code Search:** Enables you to search for code snippets within a specified repository or across all of GitHub.\n-   **Code Edit:** Provides functionality to generate documentation or a README file based on the code search results.\n\n## Code Architecture\n\nThe core components of the application include:\n\n-   `App.tsx`:  The main application component that manages the tab structure and provides the GitHub context.\n-   `components/GeneralInfo.tsx`:  Component for setting GitHub credentials and repository information.\n-   `components/CodeSearch.tsx`:  Component for searching GitHub code based on a query and file types.\n-   `components/CodeEdit.tsx`:  Component for generating documentation and README files using the Gemini API.\n-   `context/useGithubContext.tsx`:  Provides a context for managing global state, such as the GitHub token, username, repository, and search results.\n-   `api/apiconfigs.tsx`: Configures and exports axios instances for interacting with the GitHub API, and initialises the Octokit client.\n-   `geminiAPI/geminiAPI.tsx`: Handles interactions with the Gemini API for generating content.\n\n## Setup and Usage\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    cd SC4052-Cloud-Computing-Assignment-2/github-search-saas\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    ```\n\n3.  **Set up environment variables:**\n    -   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the `github-search-saas` folder.\n    -   Add your GitHub token and Gemini API key to the `.env` file:\n        ```\n        VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_token>\nVITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>\n        ```\n\n4.  **Run the application:**\n    ```bash\n    npm run dev\n    ```\n\n5.  **Open the application in your browser:**\n    -   The application should be running at `http://localhost:5173`.\n\n## How to use\n\n1.  Go to the **General Info** tab and enter your GitHub token and username. Select a repository from the dropdown list.\n2.  Go to the **Code Search** tab and enter your search query and file types. Click the **Search** button to find code snippets.\n3.  Go to the **Code Edit** tab and select the files you want to generate documentation or a README for. Click the **Generate Documentation** or **Generate README** button to generate the content.\n4.  The generated content will appear in the output textarea. You can download the content or submit a pull request to your repository.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n-   **Do not commit your `.env` file** to the repository, as it contains sensitive information.\n-   The Gemini API has certain limitations and may not always generate perfect documentation or README files.  Review the output and edit as needed.\n-   Caching has been implemented to speed up the generation process, clear this cache when required via the buttons in the code edit section.\n
